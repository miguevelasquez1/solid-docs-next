<Title>Tailwind CSS</Title>

Tailwind CSS is an on demand utility CSS library. Tailwind CSS integrates with Solid as builtin PostCSS plugin.

## Install Tailwind CSS

```sh
# Install (choose one)
npm i --save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
pnpm i --save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer   # Using pnpm
yarn add --dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer # Using yarn

# Initialize
npx tailwindcss init --poll
```

## Create a configuration

Tailwind CSS is a configuration-based tool. Use the initialize command above or create `tailwind.config.js` at the root of your project directory. It should look something like this:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Consult the offical docs for more information on configuration: [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/solidjs).

## Add Tailwind Directives

Tailwind is composed of three layers: the base layer, component layer, and utilities layer. Add these lines of code to your `src/index.css` file:

```diff
# src/index.css

+ @tailwind base;
+ @tailwind components;
+ @tailwind utilities;
```

This is a hint to PostCSS that we are using Tailwind and communicates to Tailwind which directives we are using and what their order is. Unless you know what youâ€™re doing, you should probably not change this code. But you can still append custom CSS below these directives. Note that this file will be compiled as PostCSS.

## Import Tailwind CSS

Make sure that `index.css` is imported in your root `index.jsx` or `index.tsx` file. If it isn't, add `import "./index.css"` to `index.jsx` or `index.tsx`:

```diff
# src/index.jsx

import { render } from 'solid-js/web'; import App from './App';
+ import "./index.css"

render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
```

### Usage

Now that we've got TailwindCSS setup we can get rid of the styling within the `Card.css` file or just get rid of the file entirely.

```diff
/* src/components/Card.css */

- .grid { display: grid; }
- .grid.grid-center { place-items: center; }
- .screen { min-height: 100vh; }
-
- .card {
-   height: 160px;
-   aspect-ratio: 2;
-   border-radius: 16px;
-   background-color: white;
-   box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px hsl(0 0% 0% / 15%);
- }
```

Don't forget to remove the `Card.css` import from any component that might have it imported and make use of the styling classes provided by TailwindCSS.

```diff
/* src/components/Card.jsx */

- import "./Card.css"

function Card() {
  return (
    <>
+     <div class="grid place-items-center min-h-screen">
+       <div class="h-[160px] aspect aspect-[2] rounded-[16px] shadow-[0_0_0_4px_hsl(0_0%_0%_/_15%)]">Hello, world!</div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```
